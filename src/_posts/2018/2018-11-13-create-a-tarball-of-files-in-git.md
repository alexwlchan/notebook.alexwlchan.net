"Create an archive of files from a named tree" ~ <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive>

Discovered at work while we were doing the Git migration: you can use this to get a tarball of the repository in a particular state, or of certain subsets of the repository.
Useful for passing around subsets of a repo?
