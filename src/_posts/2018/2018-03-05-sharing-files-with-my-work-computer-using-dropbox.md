title: Sharing files with my work computer using Dropbox

Problem: I have some files in my Dropbox that I want to search with my work computer (notes, my Alfred preferences, maybe a few other things).

I could log into my personal Dropbox at work, and then use Selective Sync to download just those folders locally, but that feels like it's skirting around poor data management practices.

Solution: I created a new Dropbox account with my work email, then shared the directories I want at work into that account.
I get granular control of what's shared with work, and it's harder for stuff to accidentally get into my personal account.
